description: As a researcher, I am interested in how phenotypic and genetic diversity change at large geographical scales and the factors influencing the presence of multiple phenotypes within a single population. To answer my research questions, I use spiders, especially species with multiple colors. I explore what promotes and maintains their phenotypic diversity using population genetics, macroecological analyses, and more..

## Colour polymorphism in spiders

 Species with discrete within-population phenotypic variation, also known as polymorphism, offer a fantastic model for unraveling how various factors influence phenotypic and genetic diversity over time and across different environments.Coloration is one of the most explored variable phenotypes, and its study has helped us understand how natural selection operates and drives the evolution of traits. However, most of the evidence exploring the association of coloration and environment comes from color polymorphic lineages where color is a sexual signal, creating challenges in interpreting how phenotypic diversity is independently shaped by biotic and abiotic factors. Web-building spiders are a diverse and unexplored group that definitely might give new insights into processes of local adaptation or spatial variation in selection.
