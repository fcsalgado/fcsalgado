description: As a researcher, I am interested in how phenotypic and genetic diversity change at large geographical scales and the factors influencing the presence of multiple phenotypes within a single population. To answer my research questions, I study spiders, especially species with multiple colors.

    <h2>Colour polymorphism in spiders</h2>
    <p> Polymorphic species offer a fantastic model for unraveling how various factors influence phenotypic and genetic diversity over time and across different environments. Coloration is one of the most explored variable phenotypes, and its study has helped us understand how natural selection operates and drives the evolution of traits. However, most of the evidence exploring the association of coloration and environment comes from color polymorphic lineages where color is a sexual signal, creating challenges in interpreting how phenotypic diversity is independently shaped by biotic and abiotic factors. Web-building spiders are a diverse and unexplored group that definitely might give new insights into processes of local adaptation or spatial variation in selection.</p>

    <h2>Phylogeography</h2>
    <p> Geographical barriers like mountain ranges impede genetic exchange among populations, promoting diversification. The effectiveness of these barriers in limiting gene flow varies between lineages due to each species' dispersal modes and capacities. However, our undestanding on how geographic barriers contributes to species diversification comes from well-studied vertebrates and a few arthropods and plants, neglecting organisms unable to fly or walk long distances. I study arthropods, specially spiders, to explore how mountains promotes diversification in lineage with distict disperse modes, such as long distance dispersal via ballooning (i.e. using silk to interact with the wind).</p>
